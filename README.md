🖐 Gesture-Based Digital Logic Simulator
An interactive Digital Electronics Simulator built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.
This project demonstrates fundamental digital logic concepts using real-time hand gesture control instead of physical switches.
🚀 Features
🔹 Logic Gates
AND
OR
NOT
NAND
NOR
XOR
XNOR
🔹 Arithmetic Circuits
Half Adder
Full Adder
Half Subtractor
Full Subtractor
🔹 Flip-Flops
SR Flip-Flop
JK Flip-Flop
D Flip-Flop
T Flip-Flop
🔹 Shift Registers
4-Bit Left Shift Register

🧠 How It Works
The webcam captures live video input.
MediaPipe detects hand gestures.
Open hand → Logic 1
Closed hand → Logic 0
Debounce logic ensures stable transitions.
Selected circuit processes the binary input and displays real-time output.
🛠 Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
MediaPipe
NumPy
🎯 Educational Purpose
This project helps students understand:
Boolean Logic
Combinational Circuits
Arithmetic Operations
Sequential Circuits
Flip-Flop Behavior
Shift Register Operations
It is ideal for Digital Electronics labs, academic projects, and technical exhibitions.
